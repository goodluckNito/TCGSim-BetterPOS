This plugin removes the decimal point requirement in credit card inputs. So if your total is $45.67, you can simply enter 4567 then enter.

BetterPOS.dll

Tested with BepInEx 5.4.23.2


## How to use BepInEx plugins:
Download and install BepInEx 5.4.23.2 into your game's root folder, then put the plugin's .dll file into the BepInEx/plugins/ folder (if the plugins folder doesn't exist, run the game once and close it)

You can find BepInEx releases here: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases
You will likely want BepInEx_win_x64_5.4.23.2.zip unless you have a 32-bit Windows, then get the x86 instead (or for Mac or Linux, get the appropriate version instead)
